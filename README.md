# SQL_COMPILER
A lightweight, web-based SQL compiler built using Flask and SQLite, designed to simulate the experience of online SQL editors like Programiz or OneCompiler. The app supports writing and executing multiple SQL queries, including DDL, DML, and clauses like WHERE, JOIN, ORDER BY, and more â€” all through an interactive browser interface.
